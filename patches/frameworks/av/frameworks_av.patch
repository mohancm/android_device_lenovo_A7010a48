Subject: [PATCH] Disable usage of get_capture_position

'get_capture_position' is a newly introduced API that is not yet
supported by Meizu audio HAL (as of 4.5.4I stock image), so
we disable its usage to avoid crash

Change-Id: Ieab4a8bf98011d72d913e8895ec88a05bb19908b
(cherry picked from commit 8f54bb472cb53719d3820da9cb568c09f159c27c)
